## UX
### Strategy
The primary objective of our business-to-consumer e-commerce site is to offer consumers a diverse selection of crocheted goods across various categories while providing a user-friendly platform for browsing, selecting, and purchasing these items. Additionally, we aim to enhance user engagement by offering a learning environment where users can access step-by-step walkthroughs to create their own crocheted products. The site employs intuitive navigation, responsive design, and a streamlined purchasing process to deliver an optimal user experience.

#### Agile Methodology

The project followed an Agile Project Management approach, completing *ADD* epics consisting of various user stories. These stories were categorized using MoSCoW prioritization, labeled in GitHub as *Must Have*, *Should Have*, *Could Have*, and *Won't Have*. Each user story was assigned a timebox value using the Fibonacci Sequence. Throughout the project, sprints were conducted, selecting user stories with a timebox value of no more than 8 per sprint. Epics, user stories, and bugs were tracked and visualized using GitHub's Project Kanban board feature, accessible [here.](https://github.com/users/johnamdickson/projects/3/views/1).

#### User Stories

As stated, the user stories were collated into *ADD* epics. Each user story was assigned to either the user, site admin, super user or site owner. In total there are *ADD* user stories, with *ADD* Must Have (*ADD*%), *ADD* Should Have(*ADD*%), *ADD* Could Have (*ADD*%) and *ADD* Won't Have (*ADD*%). 
<br>![user-story-breakdown]()*ADD user story breakdown graph*
The total number of story points assigned to the user stories is *ADD* of which Must Have assigned *ADD* points(*ADD*%), Should Have assigned *ADD* points(*ADD*%), Could Have assigned *ADD* points(*ADD*%) and Won't Have assigned *ADD* points (*ADD*%).

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/johnamdickson/portfolio-project-3)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/johnamdickson/portfolio-project-3)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
